def parse(file, *, recurse=True, return_configparser=False):
    """
    Reads a configuration file and returns a nested `dict`.

    The main feature of this function is the support for "adjustment files",
    i.e. files that do not actually define all values, but define deviations
    from another file. The function will collect the set of all values by
    recursing into the files defined in the initial file. This whole feature can
    be disabled, though, by passing a falsy value as the *recurse* argument, in
    which case the function just behaves like a configparser with
    :class:`configparser.ExtendedInterpolation`.

    If the *recurse* value is left at its default, the parsing process is at
    follows:

    - The file is parsed using the :class:`configparser.ExtendedInterpolation`.
    - If there is no section ``score.init``, or that section does not have a key
      ``based_on``, the parsed configuration is returned as-is. At this point
      the function was just used to parse the given file as a stand-alone file.
    - If a base file, as described earlier, was configured, that file is parsed
      first. The current file is regarded as an "adjustment file", which mangles
      the configuration provided in the base file.
    - The function now iterates on all key/value pairs of the adjustment file
      and updates the base configuration in the following manner:

      - If the adjustment value is "<delete>", the value in the original
        configuration is removed. If this leaves the section in the original
        file empty, the section is removed as well.

      - If the adjustment value starts with the string "<diff>", it is
        considered to contain a value in pseudo-diff format operating on the
        base value. The accepted format for this mode is explained later.

      - If the adjustment value is of the form "<replace:regex:replacement>",
        the regular expression given as *regex* is applied on the base value and
        the *first occurrence* is replaced with the value given as
        *replacement*. If one wants to replace *all* occurrences, it is possible
        to do so providing the flag "g" as last parameter:
        "<replace:regex:replacement:g>".

        The colons used in the example can be replaced with any
        other character, so the same rule could have been written as
        "<replace/regex/replacement>".

        It is further possible to chain multiple replace actions.

      - Otherwise the value is considered to be the replacement for the value in
        the base configuration.

    - The updated configuration is the return value of the function.

    Example with the following base file called "app.conf"::

        [score.init]
        modules =
            score.ctx
            score.db
            score.es

        [score.db]
        base = fuf.db.base.Storable
        sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///${here}/database.sqlite3
        destroyable = true

    The next file is intended to adjust the above configuration to the
    local environment::

        [score.init]
        based_on = app.conf
        modules = <diff>
            -score.es

        [score.db]
        sqlalchemy.url =
            <replace:database:app>
            <replace:\.sqlite3$:.db>
        destroyable = <delete>

    The resulting configuration will behave as if the input file looked like
    this::

        [score.init]
        based_on = app.conf
        modules =
            score.ctx
            score.db

        [score.db]
        base = fuf.db.base.Storable
        sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///${here}/app.db

    The custom diff format of this function works without line numbers and just
    consists of removals (lines with a leading dash), additions (leading plus
    sign) and anchors (leading space or no character at all).

    The only issue with this format that has no line numbers is the question
    where to insert the additions. The solution to this problem is: right after
    the last anchor, or, if there was no anchor, at the beginning of the string.

    Also note that all removals also act as anchors for this purpose.

    Here are some examples demonstrating the above::

        |foo     |+baz      |baz
        |bar  +  |      =>  |foo
                            |bar

        |foo     | bar      |foo
        |bar  +  |+baz  =>  |bar
                            |baz

        |foo     | foo      |foo
        |bar  +  |+baz  =>  |baz
                            |bar

        |foo     |-bar      |foo
        |bar  +  |+baz  =>  |baz
