def import_from_submodules():
    """
    This function must be called from a *package* initializer, i.e. the
    ``__init__.py`` file of a package folder. It will import everything defined
    in all sub-modules and sub-packages of the calling package.

    Example scenario::

        foo/
            __init__.py
            bar/
                __init__.py
                sub_bar.py
            baz.py

    If this function is called in ``foo/__init__.py``, the python package
    *foo* will contain everything, that was exported by the package
    *foo.bar* or the module *foo.baz*.

    The imports are performed as if one would have imported ``*`` from each
    sub-package. Calling this function inside ``foo/__init__.py`` is equivalent
    to writing the following two lines:

    .. code-block:: python

        from .bar import *
        from .baz import *
    """
